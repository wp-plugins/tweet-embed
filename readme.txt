Easily embed Twitter posts into your blog. **Not required for WordPress 3.4**

== Description ==

**This plugin is no longer required if you use WordPress 3.4, as the new version of the
system implements a more elegant solution for embedding tweets.** If you've previously been
using this plugin, you can safely deactivate it without having to change any of your post content.

With this plugin, you can post the URLs of Twitter status updates, just in the same way you would
with YouTube videos or Flickr photos. Put the URL of a tweet on a new line in your post, and it will
be replaced with a styled box that looks just like the tweets you see on twitter.com.

== Installation ==

Just download the plugin from the WordPress directory or install it directly from the WordPress
admin dashboard.

To install the plugin from the wordpress.org plugin directory:

1. Download `tweet-embed.zip`,
2. Unzip it and upload the `tweet-embed` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress,
