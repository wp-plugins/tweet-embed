== Description ==

With this plugin, you can post the URLs of Twitter status updates, just in the same way you would
with YouTube videos or Flickr photos. Put the URL of a tweet on a new line in your post, and it will
be replaced with a styled box that looks just like the tweets you see on twitter.com.

== Installation ==

Just download the plugin from the WordPress directory or install it directly from the WordPress admin dashboard.

To install the plugin from the wordpress.org plugin directory:

1. Download `tweet-embed.zip`,
2. Unzip it and upload the `meegloo` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress,
